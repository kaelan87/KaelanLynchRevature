# The Paris Creperie

## Project Description
A love letter to the cafe I worked at in Boston many years ago, the Paris Creperie has been warming the hearts of Brookline's residents since 1994. 
I built a REST API in order to facilitate an online ordering system for their company, with menu capabilities as well as customer account management.
